OBJECTIVE: Use birding data from UC Berkeley to calculate alpha diversity metrics (Simpson's Diversity, Estimated Alpha Diversity, Shannon Diversity).

ASSETS/RESOURCES:
- BFB Transect Data Analysis.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook used to conduct data analysis and calculate the diversity metrics.
- BFB_SP23_TP.csv: a CSV with information about the different transect periods
- BFB_SP23_TS.csv: a CSV with information about the species seen from the different transect periods
- README.md: a file with instructions on how to run the code.
NOTE: Transects 3 and 4 are missing due to issues with data collection.

REQUIREMENTS/CONSTRAINTS:
- The notebook should be run in a virtual environment that supports Jupyter and the packages used (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, and pandas). The notebook can also be run online on a website like JupyterLab or Google Colab.
- To run the notebook on Google Colab or JupyterLab, the directory has to be uploaded.
- Should Google Colab be used, the file paths in the second and third cells would have to be changed due to the upload.
- Warnings appear after the fourth cell is run. These can be ignored.
- As stated in the notebook, the dataset is rather small, so the trends observed may not be as illustrated as the trends in reality.

The methods used in this notebook's analysis and in the data collection were based off of "A Century of Avian Community Turnover in an Urban Green Space in Northern California" (2012). 

If you have any questions on how to run the notebook, you can email me at mmyen@berkeley.edu.
