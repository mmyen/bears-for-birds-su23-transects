This folder contains:
- Three datasets (BFB_SP23_PCS.csv, BFB_SP23_TP.csv, BFB_SP23_TS.csv) representing the Point Count Species, the Transect Periods, and the Transect Species. Only the last 2 were used.
- Two Jupyter notebooks: BFB Transect Data Analysis.ipynb and BFB Transect Test Join.ipynb. The first was used for all the actual data analysis. The second was used to test a join.
- This README.md file, which contains instructions on how to run the code.

In order to run the notebook, log onto datahub.berkeley.edu and upload this folder into the Jupyter datahub. Then, run each cell. If you are opening the code through an IDE like Visual Studio Code, some of the LaTeX might not show up or be incorrectly formated (unfortunately), but the plots will show up.

If you have any questions on how to run the notebook, you can message me on Slack or email me at mmyen@berkeley.edu!
